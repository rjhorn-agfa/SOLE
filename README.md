Working files for SOLE

These are various files that are being publicly shared as part of the work effort to create the SOLE profile for the IHE Radiology Committee.  See http://www.ihe.net/ for information about IHE in general, http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Radiology_Technical_Committee for information about and activities of the Radiology Committee, and http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Standardized_Operational_Log_of_Events_(SOLE) for information about this profile effort.

It is initially set as CC-BY 4.0 license.  This may change.  The final results will be published under the usual IHE licensing terms.  These are just working documents, backup material, references, etc.
